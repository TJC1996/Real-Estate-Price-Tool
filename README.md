# Real Estate Price Prediction Tool

## Overview

The **Real Estate Price Prediction Tool** is a data analysis and predictive modeling project aimed at understanding real estate trends and forecasting property prices in New Jersey. By leveraging multiple economic indicators and real estate metrics, this tool builds predictive models to estimate property values based on various features such as listing prices, market conditions, and more.

The project includes multiple datasets from different sources, such as FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) and Zillow, and uses techniques like time series analysis, interpolation, and machine learning models to clean, analyze, and predict real estate prices.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: The tool collects data from various sources related to New Jersey's housing market, including metrics like median listing price, days on market, and home price index.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handles missing data through interpolation, converts date columns to the appropriate format, and standardizes data for consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides visualizations such as correlation heatmaps and time-series plots to understand trends and relationships between key variables.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning models, specifically linear regression, to predict housing prices based on the cleaned dataset.
- **Visualization**: Generates insightful visualizations to help understand the data and trends better.
